# Docker

One image, built per machine type, holds ROS 2, the drivers' dependencies and (off the car) the simulator. The repo's code and configs are mounted into it, so you edit on the host and run in the container.

## Services

Pick the service for your machine. `arm` is used in the examples; replace it with `x86` on a PC.

| Service | Use | Simulator | Networking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `arm` | Apple Silicon Mac | yes | ports: `8765` (Foxglove) |
| `x86` | Linux / Windows PC | yes | ports: `8765` (Foxglove) |
| `jet` | Orin Nano on the car | no | host |
| `novnc` | Optional browser display for RViz (profile `gui`) | – | port `8080` |

- One image per target, built from `docker/ros/Dockerfile` on `ros:humble`.
- Bind mounts: `ros2_ws/src`, `ros2_ws/config`, `ros2_ws/maps`, `docker/ros/bashrc_polimi` (read-only, over the copy baked into the image), and `docker/ros/python3-ros` (read-only, see [Python and IDE](python.md)).
- `build/`, `install/`, `log/` live in Docker volumes (`build_arm`, …), not in the repo: build output stays out of git and is kept between container restarts.
- Ports bind to `127.0.0.1` only.

## Docker Desktop from the command line (macOS)

```bash
docker desktop start              # or: open -a Docker
docker desktop status
docker desktop restart
docker desktop stop
```

No Docker Desktop settings are needed for this repo.

## Everyday commands

The container runs in the background; you open as many shells into it as you need.

```bash
docker compose up -d arm                   # start
docker compose exec arm bash               # shell (repeat per terminal)
docker compose ps                          # what is running
docker compose logs -f arm                 # container output
docker compose exec arm cat /tmp/zenohd.log   # zenoh router log
docker compose restart arm                 # restart (e.g. zenoh router died)
docker compose down                        # stop and remove containers
```

Inside the container:

```bash
cb [colcon args]                           # colcon build --symlink-install + source, e.g. cb --packages-select f1tenth_stack
sauce                                      # re-source ROS + workspace
simcar [map] [launch args]                 # simulator as the car, see simulator.md (arm / x86)
```

`cb` and `sauce` are shell functions, so they also work from a non-interactive shell:

```bash
docker compose exec arm bash -c "source /etc/bashrc_polimi && cb"
```

### Volume ownership

Only matters if `cb` fails with a permission error.

- The image creates `~/ws/build`, `~/ws/install`, `~/ws/log` owned by the user; a **new** volume inherits that.
- Volumes created by an older image stay root-owned and `cb` fails with `PermissionError … log/build_…`. Fix once, either way:

```bash
docker compose exec -u root arm bash -c 'chown -R $USER: /home/$USER/ws/{build,install,log}'
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d arm   # or: recreate the volumes
```

## Rebuild

What to do after a change, from cheapest to most expensive:

| You change | You do |
|---|---|
| Code in `ros2_ws/src` | `cb` in the container |
| `ros2_ws/config`, `ros2_ws/maps` | nothing |
| `docker/ros/bashrc_polimi` | open a new shell (`docker compose exec arm bash`). After a branch switch that replaces it (`/etc/bashrc_polimi: No such file or directory`): `docker compose restart arm` |
| `docker/ros/python3-ros` (also after a branch switch that replaces it) | `docker compose restart arm` |
| `docker-compose.yaml` | `docker compose up -d arm` (recreates, no rebuild) |
| a `package.xml` dependency, `Dockerfile`, `GYM_REF` / `GYM_ROS_REF` | rebuild (below) |

A rebuild reuses the cache up to the first changed step. If it downloads everything again, the cache was pruned (`docker builder prune`, or Docker Desktop's automatic cleanup) or the image predates a Dockerfile change: one slow build, then it's fast again.

```bash
docker compose build arm                   # after package.xml / Dockerfile / GYM_REF changes
docker compose build --no-cache arm        # from scratch
docker compose up -d --force-recreate arm  # use the new image
```

## Optional noVNC (RViz)

Foxglove covers day-to-day visualization. For RViz, this side container serves a desktop in the browser.

```bash
docker compose --profile gui up -d novnc   # then http://localhost:8080
docker compose rm -sf novnc                # stop and remove
```

## Cleanup

Docker images and build cache grow over time.

```bash
docker compose down -v                     # also delete build/install/log volumes
docker system df                           # disk usage
docker image prune                         # dangling images
docker builder prune                       # build cache
```
